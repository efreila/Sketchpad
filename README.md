### Project Notes

This project taught me a lot about HTML, CSS, JS, and jQuery, and how they all work together to make a finished product. This is my first time using all three languages at once.

####Known Bugs

When adjusting the grid-size, the grid-size doesn't stay constant, which shifts content around on the web page.
